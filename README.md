Research on machine learning models in single cell sequencing data analysis is conducted based on comparing the performance of machine learning models including: AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Voting Classifier, XGBoost, kNN, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine to analyze single cell sequencing data.
The process goes through the stages of collecting, filtering necessary data and standardizing training data to serve the training and comparing the accuracy between models.
In which, the XGBoost model has the best accuracy in classifying genetic expressions of cells. The results show the potential of machine learning models in medical data analysis applications.
